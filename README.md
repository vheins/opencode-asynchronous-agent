# @vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that makes every subagent call run
**asynchronously in the background** — automatically — **plus a TUI sidebar
monitor** for those background subagents.

Works on **both** OpenCode V1 (`>=1.18.0`) and V2 (`>=2.0.0`):

- **`./server`** — the tool hook that forces `background = true`
- **`./tui`** — the sidebar monitor: a Saffteen-style collapsible InfoCard stack
  (activity/result, provider token report, task progress, workspace) plus
  per-subagent cards (title, activity, todo, elapsed time, Tools count, context
  used with percent). The async-agent identity
  is preserved: running/done/error/total counts, per-subagent elapsed time,
  **total tokens**, and a compact one-line status bar when the
  sidebar is collapsed.

```
Subagents · 3 runs
● 1 run · ✓ 1 done · ✕ 1 err · Σ 3
```

The sidebar renders a collapsible InfoCard stack. The `Subagents · N runs` aggregate is
rendered exactly once; each subagent appears as a single card (not a row plus a
card) showing its session title, activity, todo, elapsed time, tool-call count,
and context used with percent of the model limit. A child that
finished its turn stays visible with a **`Done`** label (rather than
disappearing), so the parent can see the subagent still exists and can be
messaged again. Each subagent card title also carries the child's todo progress
as **`completed/total`** (e.g. `Frontend · Working · 3/5`), read reactively from
the host sync store, so the parent can gauge progress without opening the child.
Running agents are listed **above** finished ones, so the live work stays at the
top of the sidebar. A finished card freezes its elapsed time at the child's last
activity instead of ticking forever. Clicking a subagent card navigates to that
subagent's session.

Above the `Creatures` card sit two animated progress bars: the main agent's own
todo completion, and the cumulative completion across the **currently active**
subagents only (finished children are excluded so they stop inflating the total).
Each bar is labelled `completed/total · NN%` and its fill tracks the real ratio
with sub-cell (eighth-block) precision; the color ramps from muted through accent
to success as progress rises, and a slow sweep highlights the filled region so a
live bar reads as loading without changing the level it reports. A bar with
nothing to report (`total` 0) collapses entirely, and the shared animation clock
stops whenever no bar has work left. The bar width scales with the terminal
between a sane minimum and maximum.
The `app_bottom` line mirrors the aggregate when the sidebar is collapsed. Status
segments are color-coded from the active theme: run (`accent`), done (`success`),
err (`error`), total (`textMuted`).

OpenCode V2 ships a keybind (`ctrl+b`, command `session.background`) that moves a
*running* foreground subagent into background observation. This plugin gives you the
same outcome **without pressing anything**: the moment the parent agent invokes the
subagent tool, the call is forced into background mode, so the parent returns
immediately with a "working in the background" notice and is notified when the child
finishes.

> **Why:** blocking on a subagent stalls the parent for the entire duration of the
> child's work. Launching it in the background lets the parent keep working on
> non-overlapping tasks and get pinged on completion — the async pattern the
> `background` flag was designed for.

---

## How it works

The plugin registers a single tool hook:

```js
await ctx.tool.hook("execute.before", (event) => {
  if (event.tool === "subagent" || event.tool === "task") {
    event.input.background = true
  }
})
```

`execute.before` runs right before a tool executes and hands the callback a **mutable**
event. Replacing or mutating `event.input` changes the arguments the tool actually
executes with — the official V2 plugin docs describe this hook as *"inspect or replace
tool input before execution."* OpenCode relies on this itself: the built-in
`opencode.tool.input.repair` plugin rewrites `event.input` for every tool, and another
built-in fixup rewrites `event.input` for the subagent tool. Setting
`event.input.background = true` is therefore all that is needed.

There is **no experimental flag** involved. In OpenCode `v2.0.x`, `background` is a
first-class, always-available field of the subagent tool schema:

```
{ agent, description, prompt, model, sessionID, background }
```

Only *nested* subagents are gated (by `experimental.subagent_depth`), which is a
separate concern.

### Tool id across versions

The subagent tool is named **`subagent`** in current V2 builds. Older builds named it
**`task`**. The plugin matches **both** ids so it keeps working across versions.

---

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```sh
opencode plugin @vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent --global
```

That installs the **server** hook (subagents run in the background). For the
**TUI monitor**, add the same package to `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` as well:

```jsonc
// opencode.json — server hook (V1 uses `plugin`; V2 uses `plugins`)
{ "plugin": ["@vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent"] }

// tui.json — TUI monitor (V1 TUI config; V1 does not read cli.json)
{ "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json", "plugin": ["@vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent"] }
```

One package, two entrypoints: the loader resolves `./server` for the server
config and `./tui` for the TUI config (a single module may not export both).

### From a local checkout

Clone this repo somewhere stable, e.g.:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent.git \
  ~/.config/opencode/plugins/opencode-asynchronous-agent
```

### 2. Register it

Add the plugin directory to the top-level `plugins` array in your OpenCode config
(`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for a global install):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": [
    "~/.config/opencode/plugins/opencode-asynchronous-agent"
  ]
}
```

Use an absolute path if your OpenCode build does not expand `~`.

### 3. Restart the service

Plugin and config changes are picked up on restart:

```sh
opencode service restart
```

That's it. The next time the parent agent spawns a subagent, it will run in the
background.

## Configuration

All configuration is optional and read from environment variables at setup time.

| Variable | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_SUBAGENT` | *(enabled)* | Set to `0`, `false`, `off`, or `no` to disable the plugin entirely. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_AGENTS` | *(all)* | Comma-separated allowlist of **parent** agent ids. When set, only these parents auto-background their subagents. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_EXCEPT` | *(none)* | Comma-separated denylist of **parent** agent ids. These parents never auto-background their subagents. |
| `OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_DEBUG` | *(off)* | Set to `1` to log each rewrite to stderr. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFY` | *(enabled)* | TUI monitor only. Set to `0`, `false`, `off`, or `no` to disable the toast shown when a background subagent finishes (`done`/`error`). |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_TASK_PROGRESS` | *(off)* | TUI monitor only. Set to a truthy value (`1`, `true`, `on`, …) to show the "Task progress" card. Hidden unless explicitly enabled. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS` | *(off)* | Opt-in. Set to a truthy value (`1`, `true`, `on`, `yes`) to register the `subagent_status` server tool. Also enables the control tools. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STALE_MS` | `120000` | Age (ms) after which a still-running child is reported as `stale`. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_CONTROL` | *(off)* | Opt-in. Set to a truthy value to register the four control tools (`subagent_children`, `subagent_result`, `subagent_cancel`, `subagent_send`). |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_RESULT_CHARS` | `20000` | Cap for the text `subagent_result` returns. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS` | *(chat)* | Progress-report mode (legacy). Truthy (`1`/`true`/`on`/`yes`) injects the report into the parent session as a text part; `0`/`false`/`no`/`off` shows a transient TUI toast instead (no model turn); unset/other values disable it. When unset, the default channel is `chat`. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFICATION_TYPE` | `chat` | Progress channel: `toast` \| `chat` \| `inline` \| `both` \| `off`. Overrides `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS`. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS_MS` | `300000` | Minimum interval (ms) between two progress reports for the same child. |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS_MAX` | `5` | Max non-final progress reports per child (the final report is never capped). |
| `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_NOTIFY` | `inline` | Completion-notice channel for `subagent_send` follow-ups: `toast` \| `chat` \| `inline` \| `both` \| `off`. Decoupled from the progress channel; defaults to `inline` (waking) so the notice is never silenced. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP` | *(enabled)* | Set to `0`, `false`, `no`, `off`, or `n` to disable database cleanup entirely. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_RETENTION_MS` | `259200000` (3 days) | Sessions untouched for longer than this have their `event` rows deleted and their old `part` tool payloads trimmed. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_INTERVAL_MS` | `21600000` (6 h) | Minimum spacing between cleanup runs. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_WAL_THRESHOLD` | `67108864` (64 MiB) | WAL size above which the governor issues a `wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)`, and above which an adaptive prune may run early. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_WAL_IDLE_MS` | `15000` | Idle window (ms): with no write this recent, the governor `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)`s the WAL. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_WAL_CHECK_MS` | `30000` | Spacing (ms) between WAL governor ticks. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_PRUNE_FLOOR_MS` | `1800000` (30 min) | Floor delay (ms) between adaptive prune passes triggered by an oversized WAL. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_MAX_OUTPUT_CHARS` | `100000` | Write-time cap for a tool part's `state.output`. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_MAX_DIFF_CHARS` | `64000` | Write-time cap for edit `metadata.diff`. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_MAX_DISPLAY_CHARS` | `64000` | Write-time cap for read `metadata.display.text`. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_MAX_DIAGNOSTICS_CHARS` | `32000` | Write-time cap for `metadata.diagnostics` (emptied to `{}` when exceeded). |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_PART_PREVIEW_CHARS` | `2000` | Length an old tool part's `state.output` is trimmed to during pruning. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_EVENT_BATCH` | `500` | Max `event` rows deleted per statement during pruning (keeps the SQLite write lock short). |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_PART_BATCH` | `500` | Max `part` rows trimmed per cleanup run. |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_VACUUM` | *(off)* | Set to `1` to `VACUUM` at shutdown after a run that deleted rows (reclaims file space; the DB ships with `auto_vacuum=0`). |
| `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_DEBUG` | *(off)* | Set to `1` to log cleanup decisions to stderr. |

### Examples

Only let the `orchestrator` parent fan out into background subagents:

```sh
export OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_AGENTS=orchestrator
```

Background everything **except** the `debugger` parent:

```sh
export OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_EXCEPT=debugger
```

Temporarily disable:

```sh
export OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_SUBAGENT=0
```

> the plugin learns the parent agent from the `chat.message` hook and remembers it
> per session. The child's own agent type is not known at call time.

---

## Subagent status tool (opt-in)

OpenCode has no built-in way for an agent to poll the liveness of the background
subagent sessions it spawned: the model is push-only, so the parent is notified
only when a child finishes. Set `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS=1` to register a
`subagent_status` server tool that reports every tracked child as
`running` / `done` / `error` / `stale`.

```sh
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS=1
```

The plugin subscribes to session events (`session.created`, `session.status`,
`session.idle`, `session.error`, `session.deleted`, message updates) and keeps an
in-memory registry keyed by child session id. A child still marked `running`
whose last event is older than `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STALE_MS` (default `120000`)
is reported as `stale`.

The tool accepts two optional filters, `parent` (parent session id) and `status`,
and returns a structured report: per-subagent `sessionID`, `title`, `agent`,
`parentID`, `status`, `elapsedMs`, `sinceLastEventMs`, and `stale`, plus aggregate
counts and the active stale threshold. When the registry is still empty it makes a
best-effort hydration call to `client.session.list()`; if that SDK method is
unavailable it reports from events only and never fails.

> **V1 only.** Custom tools and plugin event handlers are registered through the
> V1 `server` entrypoint. The V2 plugin API cannot register either, so on a
> V2-only build the V2 entrypoint no-ops (the V1 `server` entrypoint still
> registers the tool on a dual build). The tool is non-destructive and disposed
> on unload; the background-forcing hook is unaffected.

---

## Subagent control tools (opt-in, V1 only)

Background subagents are push-only: the parent is told when a child finishes, but
it cannot list children, read a child's result on demand, cancel one, or steer a
running one. Set `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_CONTROL=1` (or `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS=1`)
to register four tools that close that gap on top of the public SDK:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `subagent_children` | List a parent session's child subagent sessions with their current status. |
| `subagent_result` | Fetch a child's final assistant answer (plus terminal error and finish reason), truncated to `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_RESULT_CHARS`. |
| `subagent_cancel` | Abort a running child (for example once a sibling already answered). |
| `subagent_send` | Queue extra context into a child via the non-blocking async prompt endpoint. |

There is deliberately no `subagent_wait`. Blocking on a child defeats the
asynchronous model: OpenCode already pushes a completion notice to the parent
when a child finishes, and `subagent_children` / `subagent_result` cover
on-demand status. A wait tool is just polling in disguise.

`subagent_send` reads the child session's own `agent`, `model`, and model
`variant` (reasoning effort) and passes them through with the prompt. OpenCode's
prompt endpoint falls back to the *default* agent (and its model) whenever they
are omitted, which silently rewrites a child's identity (a `Frontend` child
becomes the default `orchestrator` on the default model). Preserving them keeps
the child on its original agent/model/variant across every follow-up message.

```sh
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_CONTROL=1
```

Every tool is non-destructive and degrades gracefully: if the running OpenCode
build lacks the underlying SDK method (`session.children`, `session.messages`,
`session.status`, `session.abort`, `session.promptAsync`), the tool returns a
short "unavailable" message instead of failing.

> **V1 only**, for the same reason as the status tool: the V2 plugin API cannot
> register custom tools. On a V2-only build the V2 entrypoint no-ops; a dual
> V1+V2 build registers the tools through the V1 `server` entrypoint.

### Parent-agent filter on V1

On V1 `tool.execute.before` does not receive the calling agent, so
`OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_AGENTS` / `OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_EXCEPT` would otherwise have no
effect. The plugin reads the agent from the `chat.message` hook (which does carry
it) and remembers it per session, so the allow/deny lists work on V1 too.

---

## Subagent progress reports (V1 only, on by default)

A background subagent runs with no visibility until it finishes. This feature
gives the parent a live progress stream, driven entirely by events (never
polling): whenever a child calls `todowrite`, OpenCode emits a `todo.updated`
event, and the plugin reports it to the parent.

Delivery is channel-based, chosen by `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFICATION_TYPE` (with
the legacy `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS` still mapped). The **default channel is
`chat`**: the report is written as a hidden, no-reply part, so the parent pays
**no model turn** while progress stays visible in the TUI (the sidebar reads the
reactive session store, never injected parts).

- **Chat** (default) — a hidden, no-reply session part (`noReply` + `ignored`):
  no model turn, not shown in the transcript.
- **Inline** (truthy `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS`) — the report is written into
  the parent session via the async prompt endpoint. It is a **visible** text part
  (not synthetic), so it renders inline in the parent's transcript, headed by an
  arrow icon, the reporting child agent, the child's session slug (its
  "nickname"), and the recipient parent, mirroring a tool-call row. Every
  injection costs the parent a full model turn.
- **Toast** (`0`/`false`/`no`/`off`) — the report is shown as a transient TUI
  toast instead, so **no model turn is spent** and the parent transcript stays
  clean. The toast title carries the child's identity (`agent · slug · session
  title`) and the message is the title of the `in_progress` todo.
- **Both** — every channel above fires.

Because every injected report can cost the parent a full model turn, reports are
coalesced:

- at most **one report per child per interval** (`OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS_MS`,
  default 300 s),
- at most **`OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS_MAX` non-final reports per child**
  (default 5), and
- exactly **one final report** when every todo is `completed`/`cancelled` (never
  counted against the cap).

A child that never calls `todowrite` produces no reports, so the plugin also
appends a short instruction to each child's system prompt telling it to keep its
todo list current (mark one item `in_progress`, then `completed` as it goes). The
instruction is injected only into child sessions, never the parent or root.

Injected report shape:

```text
⤷ frontend · hidden-panda · reporting to orchestrator · "Build checkout UI" — 1/3 done · 1 in_progress · 1 pending
  - [completed] Scaffold routes
  - [in_progress] Build form
  - [pending] Wire API
```

Toast mode (`title` / `message`):

```text
⤷ frontend · hidden-panda · Build checkout UI
Build form
```

```sh
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFICATION_TYPE=chat    # default: hidden, no model turn
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFICATION_TYPE=inline  # inject into the parent transcript
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS=0                # show a TUI toast instead
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS_MAX=5            # cap non-final reports per child
```

> **V1 only**, for the same reason as the control tools: the V2 plugin API cannot
> register event handlers or system-prompt transforms. Loop-safe by construction:
> only sessions with a parent are considered, so a parent's own `todowrite` never
> re-triggers a report.

### Completion notices (V1 only, on by default)

OpenCode pushes a completion notice to the parent only for the *initial*
`background: true` dispatch. A follow-up queued with `subagent_send` has no
parent tool part, so the plugin emulates the notice on the child's next idle.

Its channel is **decoupled from the progress channel** and defaults to `inline`
(waking), so a queued follow-up always reaches the parent even when progress is
silenced or routed to `chat`/`toast`. Override with
`OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_COMPLETION_NOTIFY` (`toast` | `chat` | `inline` | `both` |
`off`).

---

## Database cleanup (V1, opt-out)

OpenCode's session storage grows without bound. Two mechanisms cause it:

1. **Event duplication.** Every part update is written twice — once as a durable
   event row (`event` table) and once as a projection row (`part` table). The
   model reads only the projection, so the `event` copy is pure duplication kept
   for replay/sync.
2. **Unbounded tool payloads.** `edit`/`write`/`read`/`bash` results are stored
   verbatim in the `part` row, including large `metadata.diagnostics`,
   `metadata.diff`, and `metadata.display.text` blobs.

This plugin ships a cleanup layer that addresses both, in three parts:

- **Write-time cap** (`tool.execute.after`): truncates oversized `state.output`,
  `metadata.diff`, `metadata.filediff.patch`, and `metadata.display.text`, and
  empties `metadata.diagnostics` when it exceeds its budget. This prevents new
  bloat at the source. On real data a 117 KB edit metadata blob shrank to 6.5 KB.
- **WAL governor** (throttled tick, every 30 s, plus the `event` hook): OpenCode
  core runs its own in-transaction WAL auto-checkpoint (`wal_autocheckpoint`,
  ~4 MiB by default), which fires inside a write transaction and turns a write
  into an IO-block storm. The plugin cannot change core's PRAGMA, but it can keep
  the WAL small so core's auto-checkpoint rarely fires. When the `-wal` sidecar
  exceeds `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_WAL_THRESHOLD` (default 64 MiB) it issues a
  non-blocking `wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)`; once no write has happened for
  `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_WAL_IDLE_MS` (default 15 s) it issues
  `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` to shrink the WAL back to zero. TRUNCATE is **never**
  issued while a write occurred within the idle window.
- **Periodic prune** (throttled `event` hook, every 6 h): for sessions untouched
  beyond the retention window, deletes their `event` rows and trims old `part`
  tool payloads to a short preview (setting `state.time.compacted` so the model
  sees the existing `[Old tool result content cleared]` marker). It **never**
  touches `event_sequence`, `session`, or `message` rows, so session resume and
  compaction keep working. When the `-wal` exceeds the threshold it may also run
  **earlier** than 6 h, but never more often than
  `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_PRUNE_FLOOR_MS` (default 30 min), so it never hammers.

Cleanup is **enabled by default** and requires no configuration. Disable it with
`OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP=0`. It runs independently of the background-subagent flag
and is **V1 only** — the V2 plugin API exposes no event or database access.

> **Locking.** A plugin runs inside the same OpenCode process that owns the
> database, and other sessions write to it concurrently. The live paths use only a
> `wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)` (never blocks) during active writes; the blocking
> `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` is issued only when the process has been write-idle
> for `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_WAL_IDLE_MS`, and the optional `VACUUM` runs at plugin
> shutdown, when contention is gone. Running `TRUNCATE`/`VACUUM` while sessions
> are actively writing makes those sessions fail with
> `SQLiteError: database is locked`.

> **Reclaiming space.** Deletes free pages inside the DB but do not shrink the
> file when `auto_vacuum=0` (OpenCode's default). To reclaim file space, either
> set `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_VACUUM=1` (the `VACUUM` then runs at shutdown), or let
> the WAL governor truncate the `-wal` while the process is write-idle. A
> multi-GB `-wal` file usually means a long-lived session is pinning it; closing
> that session lets the next quiescent tick truncate it.

---

## Behaviour notes

- **Explicit wins.** If the caller already set `background` on the tool input, the
  plugin leaves it untouched. It only forces `background: true` when it is not already
  `true`.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running the hook on an already-backgrounded call is a no-op.
- **Non-destructive.** Only the `background` field is added; every other field
  (`agent`, `prompt`, `description`, `model`, `sessionID`, …) is preserved.
- **Clean unload.** Setup returns a cleanup that disposes the hook registration, so
  reloading the plugin does not stack duplicate hooks.
- **No child session changes.** Backgrounding is a property of the *parent's* subagent
  tool call, not of the child session. The child runs normally; the parent just stops
  blocking on it.
- **Toast notifications (TUI only).** When a background subagent transitions to `done`
  or `error`, the TUI monitor shows a short toast. It is a display-only surface — it
  never injects session parts or prompts, so it cannot affect the parent agent's loop.
  Disable with `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFY=0`.
- **V1 flag-aware.** On OpenCode V1 the plugin only injects `background: true` when
  `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS` (or `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL`) is enabled,
  so a missing flag never turns a subagent call into a hard error. On V2 the flag is
  not required.

OpenCode V2 resolves a plugin directory through its `server` entrypoint (root
`server.js` or the `./server` export). Both `server.js` and `index.js` are provided so
either resolution path works.

## Requirements

- OpenCode **V1** (`>=1.18.0`) or **V2** (`>=2.0.0`). The server hook uses V1's
  `tool.execute.before` on V1 and the V2 `ctx.tool.hook("execute.before")` API on V2;
  the TUI monitor needs a build with TUI plugin support.
- Node **>=22.13** (see `package.json`).
