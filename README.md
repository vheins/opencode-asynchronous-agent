# @vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent

An [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai) plugin that makes every subagent call run
**asynchronously in the background** — automatically — **plus a TUI sidebar
monitor** for those background subagents.

Works on **both** OpenCode V1 (`>=1.18.0`) and V2 (`>=2.0.0`):

- **`./server`** — the tool hook that forces `background = true`
- **`./tui`** — the sidebar monitor: a Saffteen-style collapsible InfoCard stack
  (activity/result, provider token report, task progress, workspace) plus
  per-subagent cards (title, activity, todo, elapsed time, Tools count, context
  used with percent, and Tok/s). The async-agent identity
  is preserved: running/done/error/total counts, per-subagent elapsed time,
  **total tokens + tokens/sec**, and a compact one-line status bar when the
  sidebar is collapsed.

```
Subagents · 3 runs
● 1 run · ✓ 1 done · ✕ 1 err · Σ 3
```

The sidebar renders a collapsible InfoCard stack. The `Subagents · N runs` aggregate is
rendered exactly once; each subagent appears as a single card (not a row plus a
card) showing its session title, activity, todo, elapsed time, tool-call count,
context used with percent of the model limit, and output Tok/s. A child that
finished its turn stays visible with a **`Done`** label (rather than
disappearing), so the parent can see the subagent still exists and can be
messaged again. Each subagent card title also carries the child's todo progress
as **`completed/total`** (e.g. `Frontend · Working · 3/5`), read reactively from
the host sync store, so the parent can gauge progress without opening the child.
Clicking a subagent card navigates to that subagent's session.
The `app_bottom` line mirrors the aggregate when the sidebar is collapsed. Status
segments are color-coded from the active theme: run (`accent`), done (`success`),
err (`error`), total (`textMuted`).

OpenCode V2 ships a keybind (`ctrl+b`, command `session.background`) that moves a
*running* foreground subagent into background observation. This plugin gives you the
same outcome **without pressing anything**: the moment the parent agent invokes the
subagent tool, the call is forced into background mode, so the parent returns
immediately with a "working in the background" notice and is notified when the child
finishes.

> **Why:** blocking on a subagent stalls the parent for the entire duration of the
> child's work. Launching it in the background lets the parent keep working on
> non-overlapping tasks and get pinged on completion — the async pattern the
> `background` flag was designed for.

---

## How it works

The plugin registers a single tool hook:

```js
await ctx.tool.hook("execute.before", (event) => {
  if (event.tool === "subagent" || event.tool === "task") {
    event.input.background = true
  }
})
```

`execute.before` runs right before a tool executes and hands the callback a **mutable**
event. Replacing or mutating `event.input` changes the arguments the tool actually
executes with — the official V2 plugin docs describe this hook as *"inspect or replace
tool input before execution."* OpenCode relies on this itself: the built-in
`opencode.tool.input.repair` plugin rewrites `event.input` for every tool, and another
built-in fixup rewrites `event.input` for the subagent tool. Setting
`event.input.background = true` is therefore all that is needed.

There is **no experimental flag** involved. In OpenCode `v2.0.x`, `background` is a
first-class, always-available field of the subagent tool schema:

```
{ agent, description, prompt, model, sessionID, background }
```

Only *nested* subagents are gated (by `experimental.subagent_depth`), which is a
separate concern.

### Tool id across versions

The subagent tool is named **`subagent`** in current V2 builds. Older builds named it
**`task`**. The plugin matches **both** ids so it keeps working across versions.

---

## Install

### From npm (recommended)

```sh
opencode plugin @vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent --global
```

That installs the **server** hook (subagents run in the background). For the
**TUI monitor**, add the same package to `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` as well:

```jsonc
// opencode.json — server hook (V1 uses `plugin`; V2 uses `plugins`)
{ "plugin": ["@vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent"] }

// tui.json — TUI monitor (V1 TUI config; V1 does not read cli.json)
{ "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/tui.json", "plugin": ["@vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent"] }
```

One package, two entrypoints: the loader resolves `./server` for the server
config and `./tui` for the TUI config (a single module may not export both).

### From a local checkout

Clone this repo somewhere stable, e.g.:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/vheins/opencode-asynchronous-agent.git \
  ~/.config/opencode/plugins/opencode-asynchronous-agent
```

### 2. Register it

Add the plugin directory to the top-level `plugins` array in your OpenCode config
(`~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for a global install):

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
  "plugins": [
    "~/.config/opencode/plugins/opencode-asynchronous-agent"
  ]
}
```

Use an absolute path if your OpenCode build does not expand `~`.

### 3. Restart the service

Plugin and config changes are picked up on restart:

```sh
opencode service restart
```

That's it. The next time the parent agent spawns a subagent, it will run in the
background.

### Examples

Only let the `orchestrator` parent fan out into background subagents:

```sh
export OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_AGENTS=orchestrator
```

Background everything **except** the `debugger` parent:

```sh
export OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_EXCEPT=debugger
```

Temporarily disable:

```sh
export OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_SUBAGENT=0
```

> The allowlist/denylist match the **parent** agent — the one calling the subagent
> tool. On V2 `execute.before` carries the caller directly; on V1, which does not,
> the plugin learns the parent agent from the `chat.message` hook and remembers it
> per session. The child's own agent type is not known at call time.

## Subagent status tool (opt-in)

OpenCode has no built-in way for an agent to poll the liveness of the background
subagent sessions it spawned: the model is push-only, so the parent is notified
only when a child finishes. Set `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS=1` to register a
`subagent_status` server tool that reports every tracked child as
`running` / `done` / `error` / `stale`.

```sh
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS=1
```

The plugin subscribes to session events (`session.created`, `session.status`,
`session.idle`, `session.error`, `session.deleted`, message updates) and keeps an
in-memory registry keyed by child session id. A child still marked `running`
whose last event is older than `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STALE_MS` (default `120000`)
is reported as `stale`.

The tool accepts two optional filters, `parent` (parent session id) and `status`,
and returns a structured report: per-subagent `sessionID`, `title`, `agent`,
`parentID`, `status`, `elapsedMs`, `sinceLastEventMs`, and `stale`, plus aggregate
counts and the active stale threshold. When the registry is still empty it makes a
best-effort hydration call to `client.session.list()`; if that SDK method is
unavailable it reports from events only and never fails.

> **V1 only.** Custom tools and plugin event handlers are registered through the
> V1 `server` entrypoint. The V2 plugin API cannot register either, so on a
> V2-only build the V2 entrypoint no-ops (the V1 `server` entrypoint still
> registers the tool on a dual build). The tool is non-destructive and disposed
> on unload; the background-forcing hook is unaffected.

---

## Subagent control tools (opt-in, V1 only)

Background subagents are push-only: the parent is told when a child finishes, but
it cannot list children, read a child's result on demand, cancel one, or steer a
running one. Set `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_CONTROL=1` (or `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_STATUS=1`)
to register four tools that close that gap on top of the public SDK:

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `subagent_children` | List a parent session's child subagent sessions with their current status. |
| `subagent_result` | Fetch a child's final assistant answer (plus terminal error and finish reason), truncated to `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_RESULT_CHARS`. |
| `subagent_cancel` | Abort a running child (for example once a sibling already answered). |
| `subagent_send` | Queue extra context into a child via the non-blocking async prompt endpoint. |

There is deliberately no `subagent_wait`. Blocking on a child defeats the
asynchronous model: OpenCode already pushes a completion notice to the parent
when a child finishes, and `subagent_children` / `subagent_result` cover
on-demand status. A wait tool is just polling in disguise.

`subagent_send` reads the child session's own `agent`, `model`, and model
`variant` (reasoning effort) and passes them through with the prompt. OpenCode's
prompt endpoint falls back to the *default* agent (and its model) whenever they
are omitted, which silently rewrites a child's identity (a `Frontend` child
becomes the default `orchestrator` on the default model). Preserving them keeps
the child on its original agent/model/variant across every follow-up message.

```sh
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_CONTROL=1
```

Every tool is non-destructive and degrades gracefully: if the running OpenCode
build lacks the underlying SDK method (`session.children`, `session.messages`,
`session.status`, `session.abort`, `session.promptAsync`), the tool returns a
short "unavailable" message instead of failing.

> **V1 only**, for the same reason as the status tool: the V2 plugin API cannot
> register custom tools. On a V2-only build the V2 entrypoint no-ops; a dual
> V1+V2 build registers the tools through the V1 `server` entrypoint.

### Parent-agent filter on V1

On V1 `tool.execute.before` does not receive the calling agent, so
`OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_AGENTS` / `OPENCODE_AUTO_BG_EXCEPT` would otherwise have no
effect. The plugin reads the agent from the `chat.message` hook (which does carry
it) and remembers it per session, so the allow/deny lists work on V1 too.

---

## Subagent progress reports (opt-in, V1 only)

A background subagent runs with no visibility until it finishes. This feature
gives the parent a live progress stream, driven entirely by events (never
polling): whenever a child calls `todowrite`, OpenCode emits a `todo.updated`
event, and the plugin injects a short report into the parent session via the
async prompt endpoint, the same channel OpenCode uses for the completion notice.

Because every report costs the parent a full model turn, reports are coalesced:

- at most **one report per child per interval** (`OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS_MS`,
  default 120 s), and
- exactly **one final report** when every todo is `completed`/`cancelled`.

A child that never calls `todowrite` produces no reports, so the plugin also
appends a short instruction to each child's system prompt telling it to keep its
todo list current (mark one item `in_progress`, then `completed` as it goes). The
instruction is injected only into child sessions, never the parent or root.

Reports are injected as **visible** text parts (not synthetic), so they render
inline in the parent's transcript, headed by an arrow icon, the reporting child
and the recipient parent, mirroring a tool-call row:

```text
⤷ frontend · reporting to orchestrator · "Build checkout UI" — 1/3 done · 1 in_progress · 1 pending
  - [completed] Scaffold routes
  - [in_progress] Build form
  - [pending] Wire API
```

```sh
export OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_PROGRESS=1
```

> **V1 only**, for the same reason as the control tools: the V2 plugin API cannot
> register event handlers or system-prompt transforms. Loop-safe by construction:
> only sessions with a parent are considered, so a parent's own `todowrite` never
> re-triggers a report.

---

## Database cleanup (V1, opt-out)

OpenCode's session storage grows without bound. Two mechanisms cause it:

1. **Event duplication.** Every part update is written twice — once as a durable
   event row (`event` table) and once as a projection row (`part` table). The
   model reads only the projection, so the `event` copy is pure duplication kept
   for replay/sync.
2. **Unbounded tool payloads.** `edit`/`write`/`read`/`bash` results are stored
   verbatim in the `part` row, including large `metadata.diagnostics`,
   `metadata.diff`, and `metadata.display.text` blobs.

This plugin ships a cleanup layer that addresses both, in two parts:

- **Write-time cap** (`tool.execute.after`): truncates oversized `state.output`,
  `metadata.diff`, `metadata.filediff.patch`, and `metadata.display.text`, and
  empties `metadata.diagnostics` when it exceeds its budget. This prevents new
  bloat at the source. On real data a 117 KB edit metadata blob shrank to 6.5 KB.
- **Periodic prune** (throttled `event` hook, every 6 h): for sessions untouched
  beyond the retention window, deletes their `event` rows and trims old `part`
  tool payloads to a short preview (setting `state.time.compacted` so the model
  sees the existing `[Old tool result content cleared]` marker). It **never**
  touches `event_sequence`, `session`, or `message` rows, so session resume and
  compaction keep working.

Cleanup is **enabled by default** and requires no configuration. Disable it with
`OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP=0`. It runs independently of the background-subagent flag
and is **V1 only** — the V2 plugin API exposes no event or database access.

> **Locking.** A plugin runs inside the same OpenCode process that owns the
> database, and other sessions write to it concurrently. The live prune path uses
> only a `wal_checkpoint(PASSIVE)` (never blocks); the blocking
> `wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` and optional `VACUUM` run at plugin shutdown, when
> contention is gone. Running `TRUNCATE`/`VACUUM` while sessions are live makes
> those sessions fail with `SQLiteError: database is locked`.

> **Reclaiming space.** Deletes free pages inside the DB but do not shrink the
> file when `auto_vacuum=0` (OpenCode's default). To reclaim file space, either
> set `OPENCODE_DB_CLEANUP_VACUUM=1` (the `VACUUM` then runs at shutdown), or
> reclaim the WAL manually with `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` while no session
> is running. A multi-GB `-wal` file usually means a long-lived session is pinning
> it; closing that session lets the next checkpoint truncate it.

---

## Behaviour notes

- **Explicit wins.** If the caller already set `background` on the tool input, the
  plugin leaves it untouched. It only forces `background: true` when it is not already
  `true`.
- **Idempotent.** Re-running the hook on an already-backgrounded call is a no-op.
- **Non-destructive.** Only the `background` field is added; every other field
  (`agent`, `prompt`, `description`, `model`, `sessionID`, …) is preserved.
- **Clean unload.** Setup returns a cleanup that disposes the hook registration, so
  reloading the plugin does not stack duplicate hooks.
- **No child session changes.** Backgrounding is a property of the *parent's* subagent
  tool call, not of the child session. The child runs normally; the parent just stops
  blocking on it.
- **Toast notifications (TUI only).** When a background subagent transitions to `done`
  or `error`, the TUI monitor shows a short toast. It is a display-only surface — it
  never injects session parts or prompts, so it cannot affect the parent agent's loop.
  Disable with `OPENCODE_SUBAGENT_NOTIFY=0`.
- **V1 flag-aware.** On OpenCode V1 the plugin only injects `background: true` when
  `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL_BACKGROUND_SUBAGENTS` (or `OPENCODE_EXPERIMENTAL`) is enabled,
  so a missing flag never turns a subagent call into a hard error. On V2 the flag is
  not required.

| `src/index.js` | The plugin implementation (`id`/`setup` for V2, `server` for V1, hook logic). |
| `server.js` | `./server` entrypoint — re-exports `src/index.js` (V1 + V2). |
| `index.js` | Alternate directory entrypoint — mirrors `server.js`. |
| `src/tui.tsx` | Source of the TUI sidebar plugin (InfoCard stack + per-subagent cards + async identity). |
| `src/model.ts` | Sidebar data helpers: `activityDetail`, `sessionMetrics`, `sidebarActivity`. |
| `src/subagent-status.js` | Opt-in `subagent_status` tool: in-memory child-session registry, staleness classification, event ingestion. |
| `src/subagent-control.js` | Opt-in control tools: `subagent_children`/`result`/`cancel`/`send` over the public SDK. |
| `src/subagent-progress.js` | Opt-in progress reports: watches child `todo.updated` events and injects coalesced reports into the parent; injects a keep-todos-current instruction into child system prompts. |
| `src/cleanup.js` | V1 database cleanup: write-time output/metadata capping, DB path resolution, stale-session event prune + old part trim, passive checkpoint inline + WAL truncate/VACUUM at shutdown. |

OpenCode V2 resolves a plugin directory through its `server` entrypoint (root
`server.js` or the `./server` export). Both `server.js` and `index.js` are provided so
either resolution path works.

---

## Requirements

- OpenCode **V1** (`>=1.18.0`) or **V2** (`>=2.0.0`). The server hook uses V1's
  `tool.execute.before` on V1 and the V2 `ctx.tool.hook("execute.before")` API on V2;
  the TUI monitor needs a build with TUI plugin support.
- Node **>=22.13** (see `package.json`).
